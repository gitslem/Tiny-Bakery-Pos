🔥 Firebase Hosting Deployment

You can host the bakery POS live on Firebase in just a few commands.

Step	Command	Description
1	npm run build	Builds production files into /dist
2	firebase login	Log into your Firebase account
3	firebase use portfolio-website-b2d98	Set your active Firebase project
4	firebase hosting:sites:create tinybakery	(Optional) Create a separate Hosting site
5	firebase init hosting	Configure your project’s hosting
6	When asked for the public directory, type: dist	Specify your Vite build folder
7	Choose: Configure as a single-page app → Yes	So /index.html handles routing
8	firebase deploy --only hosting	Deploy your app live
✅	Visit: https://tinybakery.web.app	See it live!

Example firebase.json:

{
  "hosting": {
    "site": "tinybakery",
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "destination": "/index.html" }]
  }
}

🤖 GitHub Actions (CI/CD Auto Deploy)

You can automatically deploy to Firebase every time you push to main.

Step	Description
1	Ensure your Firebase CLI is connected to GitHub (firebase init hosting:github).
2	Approve GitHub authorization and select this repo.
3	It will create .github/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml.
4	Commit and push — your site auto-deploys with every change.

Example Workflow (Manual Setup)

🧠 Developer Notes
	•	App state (cart, ledger, inventory, revenue) is persisted in browser localStorage under key tiny-bakery-pos-v2.
	•	Manager mode enables:
	•	Adding new items (pastry/bread/cake)
	•	Restocking existing inventory
	•	Toggling promotions
	•	Prices are immutable — enforced in the UI.
	•	Cake inventory is handled by slices, while other items are by units.
